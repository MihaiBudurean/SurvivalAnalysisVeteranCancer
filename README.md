# Survival Analysis of Veteran Cancer Patients

This project applies **survival analysis** methods to a veteran lung cancer dataset using **R**.
The notebook demonstrates statistical modeling and visualization of survival data.

## 📊 Project Description

The goal is to explore patient survival time and assess prognostic factors.
Steps include:

1. **Dataset Overview** – Veteran lung cancer data with clinical variables.
2. **Kaplan–Meier Estimation** – Survival probability curves.
3. **Cox Proportional Hazards Model** – Assess influence of covariates.
4. **Visualization** – Plot survival curves, hazard ratios, and confidence intervals.
